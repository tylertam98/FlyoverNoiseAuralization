# FlyoverNoiseAuralization

This repo is the auralization example of the paper *Flyover noise auralization of low-altitude aircraft in urban environments*. 



## Scenario1 (in Yau Ma Tei)

### flyover

pt_syn_ob1~8.wav: flyover noise at 8 observers.

### day_synthesized

ambient.wav: ambient noise at day time.

flyover_ob1.wav: flyover noise at Observer 1.

combine.wav: ambient noise mixed with flyover noise at day time.

### night_synthesized

ambient.wav: ambient noise at night time.

flyover_ob1.wav: flyover noise at Observer 1.

combine.wav: ambient noise mixed with flyover noise at night time.


## Scenario2 (in Kenndy Town)

### flyover

pt_syn_ob1~8.wav: flyover noise at 8 observers.

### day_synthesized

ambient.wav: ambient noise at day time.

flyover_ob1.wav: flyover noise at Observer 1.

combine.wav: ambient noise mixed with flyover noise at day time.

### night_synthesized

ambient.wav: ambient noise at night time.

flyover_ob1.wav: flyover noise at Observer 1.

combine.wav: ambient noise mixed with flyover noise at night time.
